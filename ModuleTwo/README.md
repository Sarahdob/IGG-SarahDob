Module Two Essay: Modified, Staged & Committed

Modified
The modified stage is where a file has been edited but is not committed to a database yet. This stage is known as the untracked work folder, where you can edit the file as much as you want and when you are finished you can then stage the files with all the changes that have been made. This stops developers from needing to commit every time they changes something.

Staged	
The staged area is where your file has been added/marked the file in the current version to the staging area ready for committing. 

Committed
The commit command is one of git’s core commands; once a file has been staged the commit command will take a snapshot of the staged area along with a timestamp for the repository’s history.
